# FastSpeech 2 - PyTorch Implementation

This is a PyTorch implementation of Microsoft's text-to-speech system [**FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558v1). 
This project is based on [xcmyz's implementation](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastSpeech) of FastSpeech. Feel free to use/modify the code.

There are several versions of FastSpeech 2.
This implementation is more similar to [version 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558v1), which uses F0 values as the pitch features.
On the other hand, pitch spectrograms extracted by continuous wavelet transform are used as the pitch features in the [later versions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558).


# Updates

- 2021/2/26: Support multi-speaker TTS (AISHELL-3 and LibriTTS)
- 2021/2/26: Support MelGAN and HiFi-GAN vocoder

# Audio Samples
Audio samples generated by this implementation can be found [here](https://ming024.github.io/FastSpeech2/). 

# Quickstart

## Downloads

Download the required pre-trained model from the link : [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DOhZGlTLMbbAAFZmZGDdc77kz1PloS7F?usp=sharing)
and put it in output/ckpt/LJSpeech/ or output/ckpt/AISHELL3(LJSpeech is used in example)


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the following line for your result
## Usage (Change the "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT" to the text you want to be read)
```bash
python synthesize.py --text "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT" --restore_step 900000 --mode single -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml
```
The generated utterances will be put in output/result/.
## Run the following line for your result from a file
```
python synthesize.py --source preprocessed_data/LJSpeech/filename.txt --restore_step 900000 --mode batch -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml
```
to synthesize all utterances in ``preprocessed_data/LJSpeech/filename.txt``
